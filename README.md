This challenge required pulling JSON data from the USGS website and creating a map visualization of that data depending on the depth and magnitude of the earthquake.  We were allowed to pick our dataset.  I chose all magnitude 1.0 earthquakes or larger in the past months.  Higher magnitude earthquakes are shown with larger circles, and earthquakes with greater depths are shown with darker colors.

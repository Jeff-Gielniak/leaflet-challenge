# Earthquake Visualization (using Leaflet)
Author: Jeff Gielniak
Date: 2025-03-18

This visualization required pulling JSON data from the USGS website and creating a map visualization of that data depending on the depth and magnitude of the earthquake.  I used a dataset pulling all magnitude 1.0 earthquakes or larger in the past month.  Higher magnitude earthquakes are shown with larger circles, and earthquakes with greater depths are shown with darker colors.
